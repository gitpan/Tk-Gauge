A Tk::Gauge widget creates an analog gauge.  A gauge has various
components: a radius highlighted by a circumference, one or more
needles, a hub, three granularities of tick marks, one of which has a
value label, a caption, title and specialized bands that visually
compartmentalize the gauge.

A gauge's appearance is specified by manipulating a set of
approximately 60 options, all described in the POD. Given this
flexibility one may create instruments including, but not limited to,
a 12 or 24 hour clock, CPU meter, voltmeter, fuel and temperature
gauge, speedometer and tachometer.

Note: You must apply the patch "Trace.pm.diff" before Gauge needles
will move.  The patch should appear in Tk-804.028.
